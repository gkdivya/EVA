# DETR : End-to-End Object Detection with Transformers

- Take a look at this [post](https://opensourcelibs.com/lib/finetune-detr), which explains how to fine-tune DETR on a custom dataset. 
- Replicate the process and train the model yourself. The objectives are:
  - to understand how fine-tuning works
  - to understand architectural related concepts

A readme file (along with Colab link in this README file) that:
- explains DETR
- explains encoder-decoder architecture
- explains bipartite loss, and why we need it
- explains object queries
- results
