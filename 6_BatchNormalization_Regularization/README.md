You are making 3 versions of your 5th assignment's best model (or pick one from best assignments):
Network with Group Normalization
Network with Layer Normalization
Network with L1 + BN
You MUST:
Write a single model.py file that includes GN/LN/BN and takes an argument to decide which normalization to include
Write a single notebook file to run all the 3 models above for 20 epochs each
Create these graphs:
Graph 1: Test/Validation Loss for all 3 models together
Graph 2: Test/Validation Accuracy for 3 models together
graphs must have proper annotation
Find 10 misclassified images for each of the 3 models, and show them as a 5x2 image matrix in 3 separately annotated images. 
write an explanatory README file that explains:
what is your code all about,
how to perform the 3 covered normalization (cannot use values from the excel sheet shared)
your findings for normalization techniques,
add all your graphs
your 3 collection-of-misclassified-images 
Upload your complete assignment on GitHub and share the link on LMS
Mention the name of your partners who are doing the assignment. If someone submits separately, then we will see who scored lowest, and we will assign the lowest to all. If there are NO partners, then mention there are NO parters and make sure NO one mentions your name. 
 

 

 

Bad Assignment
 

Your 6th Assignment is:

You are making 3 versions of your 5th assignment's best model (or pick one from best assignments):
Network with Group Normalization + L1
Network with Layer Normalization + L2
Network with L1 + L2 + BN
You MUST:
Write a single model.py file that includes GN/LN/BN and takes an argument to decide which normalization to include, and then import this model file to your notebook. 
Write a single notebook file to run all the 3 models above for 25 epochs each
Create these graphs:
Graph 1: Training Loss for all 3 models together
Graph 2: Test/Validation Loss for all 3 models together
Graph 3: Training Accuracy for all 3 models together
Graph 4: Test/Validation Accuracy for all 3 models together
graphs must have proper annotation
Find 20 misclassified images for each of the 3 models, and show them as a 5x4 image matrix in 3 separately annotated images. 
write an explanatory README file that explains:
what is your code all about,
how to perform the 3 covered normalization (cannot use values from the excel sheet shared)
show all 3 calculations for  4 sample 2x2 images (image shown in the content has 3 images)
your findings for normalization techniques,
add all your graphs
your 3 collection-of-misclassified-images
