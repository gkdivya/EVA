## Assignment A:
- Download this  TINY IMAGENET dataset. 
- Train ResNet18 on this dataset (70/30 split) for 50 Epochs. Target 50%+ Validation Accuracy. 
- Submit Results. Of course, you are using your own package for everything. You can look at  this  for reference. 
## Assignment B:
- Download this  downloadfile. Learn how COCO object detection dataset's schema is. This file has the same schema. You'll need to discover what those number are. 
- Identify these things for this dataset:
- readme data for class distribution (along with the class names) along with a graph 
- Calculate the Anchor Boxes for k = 3, 4, 5, 6 and draw them.
- Share the calculations for both via a notebook uploaded on your GitHub Repo
