# Object Localization

## TinyImageNet:

- Download TINY IMAGENET dataset and train ResNet18 on this dataset (70/30 split) for 50 Epochs with target of 50%+ Validation Accuracy. 

    Trained TinyImagenet for 50 epoch with 55.89% validation and 66.07% of training accuracy, details can be found [here](https://github.com/gkdivya/EVA/tree/main/10_ObjectLocalization/TinyImageNet)



## Object Detection and Anchor box using K-Means
- Download COCO dataset and learn how COCO object detection dataset's schema is. 
- Identify these things for this dataset:
  - readme data for class distribution (along with the class names) along with a graph 
  - Calculate the Anchor Boxes for k = 3, 4, 5, 6 and draw them.
  - Share the calculations for both via a notebook uploaded on your GitHub Repo
