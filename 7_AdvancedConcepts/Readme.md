# Advanced Concepts

Advance Convolutions, Attention and Image Augmentation: Depthwise, Pixel Shuffle, Dilated, Transpose, Channel Attention, and Albumentations Library

## Albumentation Library

- Faster than TorchVision inbuilt augmentation
- Better support for segmentation and object detection dataset with "label preserving transformations"
