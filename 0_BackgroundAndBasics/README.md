What are Channels and Kernels (according to EVA)?</br>
Why should we (nearly) always use 3x3 kernels?</br>
How many times do we need to perform 3x3 convolutions operations to reach close to 1x1 from 199x199 (type each layer output like 199x199 > 197x197...)</br>
How are kernels initialized? </br>
What happens during the training of a DNN?</br>
