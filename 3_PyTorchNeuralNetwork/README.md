### Problem Statement:


Write a neural network that can take 2 inputs:
* an image from MNIST dataset and
* a random number between 0 and 9

and gives two outputs:
* the "number" that was represented by the MNIST image, and
* the "sum" of this number with the random number that was generated and sent as the input to the network

Network can be written with fully connected layers and convolution layers
One-hot encoding can be used to represent the random number input as well as the "summed" output. 


### Solution:
