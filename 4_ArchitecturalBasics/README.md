# Architectural Basics

Refer to this code: [COLABLINK](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1uJZvJdi5VprOQHROtJIHy0mnY2afjNlx)
WRITE IT AGAIN SUCH THAT IT ACHIEVES
  - 99.4% validation accuracy
  - Less than 20k Parameters
  - Can use anything from below:
    -  MaxPooling,
    -  1x1 Convolutions,
    -  3x3 Convolutions,
    -  Receptive Field,
    -  SoftMax,
    -  Learning Rate,
    -  Kernels and how do we decide the number of kernels?
    -  Batch Normalization,
    -  Image Normalization,
    -  Position of MaxPooling,
    -  Concept of Transition Layers,
    -  Position of Transition Layer,
    -  DropOut
    -  Batch Size
  - Less than 20 Epochs
  - Have used BN, Dropout, a Fully connected layer, have used GAP. 
  - To learn how to add different things we covered in this session, you can refer to this code: https://www.kaggle.com/enwei26/mnist-digits-pytorch-cnn-99 DONT COPY ARCHITECTURE, JUST LEARN HOW TO INTEGRATE THINGS LIKE DROPOUT, BATCHNORM, ETC.
