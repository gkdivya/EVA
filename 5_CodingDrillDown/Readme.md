- Achieve 99.4% accuracy on test data (this must be consistently shown in last few epochs, and not a one-time achievement)
- Less than or equal to 15 Epochs
- Less than 10000 or 8000 Parameters 
- Do this in exactly 3 or more steps
- Each File must have "target, result, analysis" TEXT block (either at the start or the end)
- You must convince why have you decided that your target should be what you have decided it to be, and your analysis MUST be correct.
